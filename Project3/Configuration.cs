/*The Configuration class reads in data from a file that determines the parameters of the
simulation. From the configuration file, the user should be able to adjust the following:
 The mean population size of a location at the start of the simulation.
 The standard deviation of the population size of a location at the start of the simulation.
 The percent chance of the disease spreading to another person at the same location.
 The percent chance of the disease flagging a person as dead.
 The number of hours that the disease last.
 The number of hours that a quarantine last.
 The mean percent chance of a person entering quarantine.
 The standard deviation of the percent chance of a person entering quarantine.
 How long the simulation should last.
 The percent chance that a person will travel each hour of the simulation.
(Note: From the configurable settings above, you may extrapolate additional requirements.
